# assignment1
First assignment for bootcamp.

The repository (assignment1) is where you will find my attempted corrections for the Horiseon Social Solution Services website. Attempts were made to clean up the HTML and provide sound semantics within that HTML.

The navigation bar was classified as a <nav> element and the links that were referenced in the HTML were properly sorted and made to respond in an appropriate manner (when you click on "Search Engine Optimization" you are take to "Search Engine Optimization" and not to one of the other features).

One element that I was not able to resolve to my satisfaction was the <span> element, I realized early on that "SEO" in the brand logo needed to stand out to highlight the "search engine optimization" of the company, but I was unable to resolve the HTML and it makes that line of code look sloppy.

All the images supplied with the page have been given alt attributes and title attributes as well for accessibility. Box-sizing was corrected so that all of the boxes on the page are presented as the shoudl be, and are equal to each other's height.

I added comments to the CSS where I thought appropriate to mention the minor changes that were made to the style.css file.
